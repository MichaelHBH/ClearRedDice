# ClearRedDice

#### 'Clear Red Dice' is an attempt at a diceware password generator written in Ruby.
##### To start, it will roll five virtual die to create a 5 digit number used to look up a word in the library, which will be stored in in a variable. This process will be repeated six times. Eventually it should let the user choose which library is used for generation.
